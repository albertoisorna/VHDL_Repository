ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

   NOTE:  An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and
   will not process successfully through PAR.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   180 out of  11,440    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 180
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        138 out of   5,720    2%
    Number used as logic:                      138 out of   5,720    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             136
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          200
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            20 out of     200   10%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  62 out of     200   31%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         118 out of     200   59%
    Number of unique control sets:               8
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              28 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
